# H5BPCodeKit
H5BPCodeKit is a collection of frameworks and utilities that work in
unison to form a simple starting point for building apps (without the
CLI). You'll need CodeKit (or similar pre-processor) to get started
with pre-compiling. ~~Extras & Theme packages are included as well
for Coda, and other commonly used code editors.~~ (Coming Soon)

This repo will be kept in sync with each stable
[HTML5 Boilerplate](https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate) release.
If you have ideas to enhance or make this better - start cloning and
have at it.
